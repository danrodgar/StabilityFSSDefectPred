\acrfull{fs} consists of choosing among the input variables those that are most relevant. There are different algorithms that are responsible for selecting the features that seem relevant to them. Not everyone chooses the same characteristics as important. Different algorithms can select different variables. Depending on the algorithm used, the selected features change. You can measure how stable those \acrshort{fs} algorithms are on a given data set. In this project, different packages in R will be known to perform the selection of attributes, they will be tested with different datasets and different metrics will be applied to the results.
