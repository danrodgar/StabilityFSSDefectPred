Stability

Consistency index [15] is used to measure the degree of similarity between the metric rankings of two feature selection techniques.

The consistency index takes into consideration bias due to chance. We compute the consistency index
between two feature subsets as follows. Let $T_i$ and $T_j$ be subsets of features, where $|Ti| = |Tj | = k$. The consistency index [15] is obtained as follows:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:CI}
    I_C (T_i, T_j ) = frac{dn-k^2}{k(n-k)}
\end{equation}



where $n$ is the total number of features in the dataset, $d$ is the
cardinality of the intersection between subsets $T_i$ and $T_j$ , and
$-1 < IC (Ti, Tj) < 1$. The greater the consistency index, the
more similar the subsets are. If the two rankings are the same, then $I_C=1$.

If there is no overlap between two rankings, then the consistency
index is -0.1667???

We consider two algorithms to be similar if they share 2/3 out of the top features.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Threats to Validity %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%\section{Threats to Validity}
%\label{sec:threats}
%
%As with all empirical studies, there are some threats to validity that need to be considered in this study.

%\emph{Construct validity} is the degree to which the variables used in the study accurately measure the concepts they are supposed to measure. We have only used those projects classified with the quality attribute classified as A or B. Although there seems to be an agreement about the practical usefulness of publicly available repositories and a large amount of work using such datasets, the origin of the data is not completely known and therefore such a risk is present. There is also a risk in the way that the preprocessing of the dataset was performed (e.g., considering that all versions of Visual Basic are equivalent, unifying the consistency across the languages and their generation type, etc).
%
%\emph{Internal validity} is the degree to which conclusions can be drawn. A major threat can be related to the preprocessing performed. Although we have reported and specified each step, we may have discarded relevant attributes or joined values incorrectly. We also needed to deal with a large number of missing values for some of the attributes. For example, after the preprocessing, the maximum team size and average time size variables have almost 60\% and 80\% of missing values respectively with the risk of being very few or even a single organisation reporting such attributes. It could have been very valuable to know which projects correspond to a particular company, and other measures about personnel stability. The ISBSG does not report detailed information about the personnel characteristics and it is known that there are large differences in productivity. Therefore, projects of similar size can differ hugely in the amount of time and effort required. We are not able to analyse such characteristics with this repository. We believe that their usefulness is not clearly proven for some data mining and statistical analyses.
%
%\emph{External validity} is the degree to which the results of the research can be generalised to the population under study and other research settings. Although the data comes from real projects and is in principle, generalisable, the ISBSG organisation recognise these project may not be representative of the industry (they are selected by the companies providing the data which in turn belong to the better performed organisations with experience  using function point estimation techniques). In the context of estimation, Kitchenham et al.~\cite{Kitchenham:2007} performed a Systematic Literature Review of predictions from cross-company models with predictions from within-company models. Although the authors state that their results are inconclusive as there is support in both directions, it seems to be easy to misuse cross-company models. In any case, each organisation should select and perform the studies and estimations with subsets of the data close to their domain and organisation type, environment, language, etc.

\section{Conclusions and Future Research Directions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this paper, we analysed

In future work, further statistical and data mining studies will be performed with the ISBSG repository as well as other repositories in order to study the quality of such repositories, validate generic claims found in the literature and provide guidelines for decision making.
